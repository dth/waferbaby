This is the source code for waferbaby.com (being the fifth version out of scores of revisions over the years).

It's a Merb app. Merb is a nice little MVC framework written in Ruby. You might like it! It likes you.

	http://merbivore.com/ (nb: waferbaby sits on top of the 0.94+ nightly builds)

waferbaby also uses the following gems:

	* DataMapper (a nice ORM)
	* RDiscount (for Markdown)
	* Merb-Auth (the user system)
	
I'm offering the code up to the world with the hope that someone, somewhere will find it vaguely useful.

Enjoy!
