This is the source code for waferbaby.com (being the 'official' fifth version out of scores of revisions over the years).

It's a Merb application. Merb is a nice little web framework written in Ruby. You might like it! It likes you. Really, it told me.

	http://merbivore.com/ (nb: waferbaby currently uses v0.97 at the time of writing)

And waferbaby also uses the following gems:

	* DataMapper (a nice ORM)
	* HAML (for the static HTML markup)
	* RDiscount (for dynamic markup via Markdown)
	* UUID (for generating unique goodness)
	
I'm offering up the whole codebase to the world with the vague hope that someone, somewhere will find it useful.

Enjoy!
